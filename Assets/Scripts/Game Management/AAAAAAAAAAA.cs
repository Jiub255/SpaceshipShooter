	-----

	Prototype full level.

		Make boss fight at end.
			Boss floats along with you instead of flying past. 
		End level UI/screen.

	Shop 
		Comes up after beating a level. 
		Can buy new ships/weapons/items with money from levels. 
		Have separate inventories for ships, weapons, and items. 

	Prepare for level 
		Comes up after done shopping. 
		Choose which ship to use.
		Choose which guns to put on it. 
		Deal with items later, not sure how/if it will be implemented. 
		Once ready, start next level. 

	Keep track of all the stats.
		Kills (of each enemy type and totals)
		Time played
		Money earned
		Money spent
		Percent complete
		Bullets fired
		Everything

	JUICE!
		SFX/Music
		Screen shake?
			At least shake the sprite that got hit.
		Particle effects, for getting hit and for dying. 
		Shake player ship when shooting, like recoil? 
		Definitely screen shake when colliding with other enemies.

	Top view spaceship shooter. 
	Background and enemies move down past you to make it seem like you're moving. 
	Able to upgrade/buy new ships/weapons/usable items, using money you collect from each round. 
	Each level has either a timer or a certain number of enemies, then a boss fight.
		Boss floats along with you, unlike enemies who will fly past. 
		Maybe have mini-bosses in the middle of the levels? 

	Gameplay Loop
		Play through level, kill enemies, collect money/items, kill boss.
		Shop for new ships/weapons/items.
		Choose ship/weapons/items for next run.
		Repeat.
