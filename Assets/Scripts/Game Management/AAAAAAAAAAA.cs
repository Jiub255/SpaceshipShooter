class AAAAAAAAAAA
{/*
	

	Top view spaceship shooter. 
	Background and enemies move down past you to make it seem like you're moving. 
	Able to upgrade/buy new ships/weapons/usable items, using money you collect from each round. 
	Each level has either a timer or a certain number of enemies, then a boss fight.
		Boss floats along with you, unlike enemies who will fly past. 
		Maybe have mini-bosses in the middle of the levels?
