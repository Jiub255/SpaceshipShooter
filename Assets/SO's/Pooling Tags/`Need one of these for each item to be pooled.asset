  m_Name: '`Need one of these for each item to be pooled'
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  DetailedExplanation: 'Need to create a new PoolTagSO for each object you want to
    be pooled. Also need to put a PoolTag script on the object and assign it that
    same PoolTagSO. It''s a little more involved to set up, but it''s more flexible
    than enums, and less error prone than strings. '
